## ðŸ§  About Me
Hello! My familiarity with the world of computers began at the age of six when I got my first computer from my uncle. This experience ignited my interest in computers, and I continued to experiment with them, even though my curiosity often led to breaking things. At the age of 11, I was introduced to programming with a software language like Scratch by my school's computer teacher. However, due to the lack of knowledgeable individuals in my surroundings, my interest was put on hold for a while.

At the age of 14, I encountered the world of cybersecurity, but at that time, there weren't enough Turkish resources available, and my English skills were not sufficient to access information freely. As a result, this curiosity was postponed for years.

I entered university and initially pursued a degree in molecular biology. However, it didn't take long for me to realize that my true passion lay in computers. I switched to computer engineering and began to adapt quickly to software logic. I started learning C programming language along with Python.

During my early years in university, I rediscovered cybersecurity and learned many things through platforms like TryHackMe, where I reached the top 2% globally. I solved more than ten Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and attempted to hack virtual machines I set up on platforms like VulnHub. Additionally, I was captivated by fields like Incident Response in the realm of red teaming, and I started working on mastering the required skills.

Currently, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who not only uses tools like Burp Suite and Metasploit but also develops my own custom tools using Python. Furthermore, with the goal of merging artificial intelligence with the field of cybersecurity, I've been focusing on learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, the ever-evolving nature of the cybersecurity community made me realize that I should prioritize cybersecurity over AI and put my AI plans on hold.

Cybersecurity is my passion, and I continue to constantly improve myself in this field. I'm open to any advice and suggestions, and I'm actively searching for internship opportunities as part of my university's mandatory internship program.
